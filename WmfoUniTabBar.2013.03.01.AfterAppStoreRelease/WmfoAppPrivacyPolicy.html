    <font face="helvetica" size=2>
    <br><br>
    We respect your privacy and do not collect personally identifiable information about you through the WMFO iOS app or our website. In other words, we do not collect information such as your name, address, phone number, email address or unique Apple device identifier.
    <br><br>
    We do not use or collect your geographic location.
    <br><br>
    We do not allow advertising companies to collect data through our service for ad targeting.
    <br><br>
    In the event that our app should crash, the system creates a crash log with information including your unique Apple device identifier, as well as other data to find out what went wrong. If you choose to send us the crash log, please be aware that this log data could potentially contain personal or otherwise private information.
    <br><br>
    We take reasonable steps to secure your personally identifiable information against unauthorized access or disclosure. However, no security or encryption method can be guaranteed to protect information from hackers or human error.
    Information we collect may be stored or processed on computers located in any country where we do business.
    <br><br>
    Our privacy policy may change from time to time. If we make any material changes to our policies, we will place a prominent notice on our website or application.
    <br><br>
